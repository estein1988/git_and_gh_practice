I've been to 41 of the United States' 50 states. I hope to get to all 50 by the age of 50.
I've been to the hardest for most folks, Alaska and Hawaii.

I've been to 7 international countries:
1. Canada
2. Mexico
3. Ecuador
4. Costa Rica
5. Nicaragua
6. Israel
7. Thailand

My favorite country out of those 7 was probably Ecuador, but they all have great things about them!
